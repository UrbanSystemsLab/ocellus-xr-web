## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# Create .env at the root of the repo containing environment variables with the following terminal command:
./create-env-file.sh
# Provide your own environment variables
# If you run into any issues such as "permission denied", type:
chmod u+x ./create-env-file.sh
# then run ./create-env-file.sh again.

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

## Environment Variables
A file named `.env.example` contains the names of the values that you will need in order to get this app to run properly. When running the app locally, you'll need to add a `.env` file into root folder of the local repository. In it, copy the text from `.env.example` and add the necessary values.
